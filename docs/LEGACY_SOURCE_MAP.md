# Legacy Donor-Source Map

The new repository is standalone. Donor code may be migrated only through an
explicit entry here and may never become a runtime import from `Fresh_check`.

## Inspected donor snapshot

```text
repository:
C:\Users\22rya\ComputerScience\CERN\Fresh_check

inspected commit:
bfcda5bd6fd48037ab198bcca1eadf6f4d87e131

worktree:
dirty at Block-1 inspection
```

Because the donor worktree was dirty, the commit alone is insufficient for
uncommitted donor files. Each migration block must additionally record the
exact donor path and source content hash used.

## Migrated code

Transfer Block 1 contained new scaffolding only. Transfer Block 2 extracted and
rewrote the following semantics without donor runtime imports:

| Donor path and SHA-256 | New paths | Retained semantics | Intentional changes and evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `jetclass_fresh/jetclass_data.py` — `30bbb947f83aeab9b190af640842071af075a558e1e12f7018f6ae96edf248ea` | `src/hlt_classification/data/{schema,identity,root_reader,splits}.py` | class order, longest-prefix mapping, 14 channels, 128 cap, transformations, bounded retries, chunk ordering, per-role sampling RNG, global shuffle | canonical recursive parent root; one root-relative namespace; label-bound identity plus label-free leakage key; strict branches/lengths/finiteness/PID/one-hot checks; stronger capacity/balance/overlap audit; versioned self-hashing immutable atomic manifest; streaming iterator. Covered by `tests/test_data_foundation.py`. |
| `scripts/build_jetclass_splits.py` — `87293fff44a413c5e6e833a2bfcddf422fe3e2017a077b6bbaade9ecba99b222` | `scripts/build_splits.py` | explicit split sizes and report | rewritten standalone CLI; single recursive root; production fail-closed; authenticated atomic output. |
| `scripts/preflight_relational_part_data.py` — `c15cb8c30100809f6b6804ccaea425b545e3598c41e877c0b7d0d7682c8ea780` | `scripts/preflight_data.py` | class capacity preflight | generic standalone CLI; full branch schema validation; diagnostic skips can never be production-eligible. |

The donor test reference was
`tests/test_jetclass_data.py` at
`80095b50141e34249b4561c6293f710e87559fb3a13362bf030e6808042d2c7d`.
The new suite broadens its assertions and uses actual synthetic ROOT fixtures.
No third-party source was copied, so this block adds no new source-license
obligation beyond the declared Python dependencies.

Transfer Block 3 migrated the registered HLT-v3 v1 scientific kernel:

| Donor path and SHA-256 | New path | Retained semantics | Intentional changes and evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `teacher_logit_reco/relation_expert_token_bridge/hlt_v3.py` — `3f8509486818469fc63990eccb9d09182df460ae593efef474f4a6a3b9311037` | `src/hlt_classification/data/hlt_v3.py` | profile parameters, degradation profiles, type multipliers, PID transitions, operation order, substream IDs, threshold/loss/merge/response algorithms, mass preservation, stable sorting, validity states, and diagnostics | removed RETB/cache imports; strengthened invalid-type and finite validation; assigned serialized metadata a repository-specific contract name; retained donor random-domain bytes for registered-v1 output parity. Golden array and diagnostic hashes plus focused mechanism tests are in `tests/test_hlt_v3.py`. |
| `teacher_logit_reco/relation_expert_token_bridge/replicas.py` — `fe3013ac4543d048287527bb326c6ea943251b9448170c4f2fbc1dcc6181ffa8` | `src/hlt_classification/data/replicas.py` | policies, donor role seeds, random multipliers, identity cycle, event seed derivation, and evaluation replica zero | removed RETB contract dependency; added canonical `model_val=3054` and `stack_train=3055` domains required by the new five-role split while preserving every donor-existing mapping; added a repository-specific self-authenticating manifest contract, strict input validation, and detached manifest payloads. |
| `jetclass_fixed_hlt.py` — `c222a9233b1a5284a57bbcf2e253c83d3d7679ff26f5e825c854e8cece3bb2e4` | `src/hlt_classification/data/hlt_v3.py` | phi wrapping, local density, v2 efficiency base terms, and v2 kinematic base terms only | excluded legacy v1/v2 builders, CLI, caches, and unrelated profiles; inlined only the inherited formulas needed by registered HLT-v3. |

The focused donor test reference is
`tests/test_relation_expert_token_bridge_step2.py`. Block 3 does not copy
third-party source and introduces no new dependency or license obligation.

Transfer Block 4 inspected both legacy cache surfaces and rewrote them rather
than copying either monolithic format:

| Donor path and SHA-256 | New paths | Retained semantics | Intentional changes and evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `jetclass_fresh/hlt_cache.py` — `5631ac115a4f352739492e0db06c5e9c3111fa52d522d273243504e0731823c4` | `src/hlt_classification/data/{cache_contracts,offline_cache,dataset}.py` | bounded cached raw views, stable identity order, reusable HLT-facing dataset access | split offline and degraded caches into distinct versioned contracts; deterministic NPZ bytes; per-array and per-file hashes; atomic immutable sidecars and manifests; bounded cross-shard reads; exact source/split/schema/generator lineage. |
| `teacher_logit_reco/relation_expert_token_bridge/hlt_cache.py` — `57d0dde4e4aad5aa622fc62c2020954ae69a0108cf89178d7304dabd2f6345e4` | `src/hlt_classification/data/{cache_contracts,hlt_cache,dataset}.py` | deterministic degradation from authenticated offline parents, replica/profile binding, resumable shards, aggregate diagnostics | removed RETB campaign coupling and construction-index exposure; added source-snapshot and exact parent-range hashes; made processing-batch and physical-shard layouts semantically invariant; added standalone build/audit CLIs. |

Block-4 failure injection and byte-level resume/layout evidence is in
`tests/test_cache_pipeline.py`. No donor runtime import or third-party source
was copied.

Transfer Block 5 migrated the canonical model-input and adapter semantics:

| Donor path and SHA-256 | New path | Retained semantics | Intentional changes and evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `jetclass_fresh/part_inputs.py` — `6e237ba0eec33ef9a2b78cde579896b02c5b739ccd8126de0512774eef30166a` | `src/hlt_classification/data/part_inputs.py` | two point coordinates, exact ordered 17-feature transform, four-vectors, supplied-view axis reconstruction, padding, and all-empty safety | removed donor package and candidate-weight coupling; accepts the standalone 14-token `JetView`; adds strict dtype, finite, padding, identity, label, and explicit source-view validation plus a repository-specific contract. Covered by `tests/test_part_inputs.py`. |
| `jetclass_fresh/hlt_baseline.py` — `982c1696967b809fd534add1766f9b780fb858297f334036a7d9aa84f078a418` | `src/hlt_classification/models/particle_transformer.py` | lazy Weaver construction, exact standard-four canonical architecture, input delegation, and class-token no-weight-decay name | excluded donor dataset/training code; mixed precision is disabled by the authoritative FP32 runtime rather than passed as a noncanonical model constructor argument; adds logits/input-gradient/parameter-gradient/mask/state-dictionary attestation. Covered locally with an interface-faithful test double; authoritative real-Weaver execution remains pending. |

Both donor files were inspected at commit
`bfcda5bd6fd48037ab198bcca1eadf6f4d87e131` and were clean at their recorded
paths. No Weaver source was copied. `weaver-core` and PyTorch are optional
model dependencies and retain their upstream licenses.

Transfer Block 8 copied and contract-rebased the reviewed HOSD scientific
plan:

| Donor path and SHA-256 | New path | Retained semantics | Intentional changes and evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `teacher_logit_reco/HLT_OFFLINE_STRUCTURE_DISTILLATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — `0d4eaab71c13dd64a4af326d085f35259490b90eca084c60d6c6c3a24325a937` | `docs/plans/HLT_OFFLINE_STRUCTURE_DISTILLATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | all scientific questions, target definitions, controls, split counts, access rules, stages, selectors, metrics, statistics, locks, and acceptance criteria | replaced old repository/runtime paths with `src/hlt_classification/hosd` and local reusable contracts; retained optional donor comparators; required local ports plus donor-parity tests for missing RPT/RETB semantics; reset donor-only implementation statuses. No executable donor code was copied by this document migration. |

## Deliberately excluded

Do not migrate checkpoints, caches, logs, run registries, historical campaign
IDs, unrelated campaign packages, old handoffs, or broad script collections.
